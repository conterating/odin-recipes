    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Prepare delicious chicken nuggets by cutting boneless, skinless chicken
      breasts into bite-sized pieces or strips. Coat them first in a seasoned
      flour mixture, then dip into beaten eggs, and finally coat with
      breadcrumbs or crushed cornflakes for a crispy exterior. For a healthier
      option, bake in the oven at 400°F (200°C) for 15-20 minutes, flipping
      halfway through, or fry in oil heated to 350°F (175°C) for 3-4 minutes per
      side until golden brown and cooked through. Serve hot with your favorite
      dipping sauces. These homemade chicken nuggets are perfect for any
      occasion and sure to please both kids and adults alike.
