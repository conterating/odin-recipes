    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a delicious apple pie filling is a wonderful way to capture the
      essence of autumn in a dessert. Begin by selecting a variety of apples
      known for their firm texture and balanced flavor, such as Granny Smith,
      Honeycrisp, or Braeburn. Peel, core, and slice the apples into uniform
      pieces, about half an inch thick. In a large bowl, toss the apple slices
      with a mixture of sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pinch of salt. This
      seasoning blend enhances the natural sweetness of the apples while adding
      warm, aromatic notes to the filling.
